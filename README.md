## Description
- STM32f411RE Nucleo Bare-metal programming.
- These should be good source codes/examples for those who study bare-metal programming with any STM32 board.
- Device Drivers (planning to implement I2C, SPI, CAN, ADC, and DAC with DMA and RTOS.)

## Getting started

### Installing
- Download STMCubeIDE @ [https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en.html](https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en.html).
### Header
